Can walk around it in a few minutes. Low crime rate! A bit like a gated community. Paradise! Native entertainment in the evening.<br /><br />On the way back, I met the bus driver that had taken me from the airport to the ferry. He invited me home, introduced me to his family, and cooked a nice dinner (chicken rice). Many peoples are wonderfully hospitable.
