Just been back in HK for two weeks, and already two old friends from Germany have visited (independently). Here's Jamil and me in front of my office:<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yqEhhQ7fH4w/Rew0QBYoXHI/AAAAAAAAAbo/ZksZG-EN4Ac/s1600-h/with+Jamil,+Exchange+Square.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yqEhhQ7fH4w/Rew0QBYoXHI/AAAAAAAAAbo/ZksZG-EN4Ac/s320/with+Jamil,+Exchange+Square.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5038459532975037554" /></a><br />Yesterday, Olaf and his wife called unexpectedly - they had just arrived in HK for two days. We went to Stanley market and the peak - the view was very good this time, then had a few drinks in the Four Seasons, and I went off to the Youssou N'dor concert. Afterwards, drinks in Fong's and the Kee club.<br /><br />Today, Sebastian, Jörn and I went gocarting in Zhūhǎi 珠海 in China (close to Macau). It had rained, and there was a lot of skidding and sliding. For a short period in the last race, I was first - then I made a mistake and was overtaken, and then my gocart died. Heaps of fun nevertheless.
