In Mandarin Chinese, America is called "美国", land of beauty, while Germany is "德国", land of virtue. Now, these names are flattering at first; but then, "美“, beauty, is pronounced <i>měi</i> as in A<b>me</b>rica, and "德" is <i>dé</i> as in <b>Deu</b>tschland. The suspicion that these names are phonetic rather than meaningful is driven home by the fact that the translation of "France" is "法国", land of law/order <i>(Fǎguó)</i>, and of "England" "英国", land of heros <i>(Yīngguó)</i>.<br /><br />Other nice phonetic names are "意大利" <i>(Yīdàlì)</i> for Italy and "加拿大" <i>(Jiānádà)</i> for Canada.<br /><br />Intriguingly, the character for beauty, "美", is composed of "羊", meaning sheep, and "大", big, so (at least at some point in Chinese History), big + sheep = beautiful.<br /><br />Hence one could argue that in Chinese, America is the land of big sheep.
